# -TOTK-First-Trigger---Practice-Mod
This mod allows you to practice the first trigger in the Tears of the Kingdom introduction without being interrupted by a cutscene.

- Once installed, the title screen will no longer have a background (only the title and buttons).
- Start a new game or load a save anywhere in the introduction.
- The first trigger no longer plays the cutscene but instead teleports you just before it for quick retries.

Perfect for efficient practice on this skip.
